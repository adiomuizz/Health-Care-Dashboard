# Health-Care-Dashboard
This dashboard offers a comprehensive view of healthcare financial operations, focusing on billing distribution, cost centers, and departmental performance.

<h1>📊 Project Overview </h1>

This project features an interactive Executive Dashboard designed for healthcare administrators to monitor financial health, billing efficiency, and service utilization. It consolidates data from multiple streams, including medications, treatments, and insurance, into a single pane of glass to identify revenue drivers and cost-saving opportunities.


<h1>📈 Dashboard Interpretation & Insights</h1>

<h2> 1. High-Level KPIs (Header Row) </h2>
The top cards provide an immediate health check of the provider's financials:

- Total Amount Billed: €4.2M (The primary revenue metric).

- Primary Costs: Treatment costs (€2.6M) are the largest expense, significantly higher than Medication costs (€546K).

- Revenue Gap: There is a €2.0M gap between billing and insurance coverage, representing the Out-of-Pocket burden on patients.

- Average Billing: The average patient visit generates £851.10 in revenue.

<h2> 2. Billing by Procedure (Diagnostic Efficiency) </h2>	
The vertical bar chart highlights which diagnostic services generate the most revenue:

- X-Ray is the leading revenue generator at 33% (£1.4M).
  
- Advanced imaging (CT and MRI scans) combined account for 41% of procedure billing.
  
- Basic tests, such as ultrasound and Blood Tests, contribute the least to the total billing volume.


<h2> 3. Billing by Department </h2>	
The horizontal bar chart compares departmental performance:

- Orthopedics is the most profitable department, accounting for 26.74% (£1.13M) of total billing.

- Pediatrics shows the lowest billing volume at 13.07% (£553K).

- Cardiology and General Surgery maintain a close middle-ground, both hovering around 22-23%.
  

<h2> 4. Diagnosis and Service Type (The "Care Mix") </h2>
The 100% stacked bar chart provides insight into how care is delivered for specific conditions:

- Outpatient care (Purple) is the dominant service type across all major diagnoses (Hypertension, Appendicitis, Migraine), consistently exceeding 50% for most.
  
- Emergency services (Black) are most frequently utilized for Asthma (29.9%) and Appendicitis (28.2%), highlighting the acute nature of these conditions.

- Inpatient care (Pink) is most prevalent in Fracture cases (32.45%), likely due to surgical requirements.

  <h1> 🚀 Key Takeaways </h1>
- Revenue Concentration: Over 50% of procedural revenue comes from X-rays and CT scans. Investing in imaging throughput could further increase margins.

- Out-of-Pocket Sensitivity: With €2.0M in out-of-pocket costs, the provider is highly susceptible to patient credit risk and collection delays.

- Departmental Focus: Orthopedics is the "Anchor Department." Ensuring high-quality staffing and equipment in this area is critical for maintaining the current revenue stream.


  <h1> 📂 How to Use the Dashboard </h1>
- Year/Race Filters: Use the top-right slicers to segment the data by demographic or fiscal period.

- Location Filter: Use the left-hand dropdown to view billing performance for specific clinic or hospital branches.

- Cross-Filtering: Click on any department (e.g., Orthopedics) to see how the Diagnosis and Procedure charts update to reflect that specific department's data.
